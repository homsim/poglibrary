- [X] How to neatly populate the `author_book` JoinTable?
- [X] Use naming conventions for the DB fields
- [X] (Add endpoint for the) addition of a book via isbn: OpenLibraryAPI
- [ ] Refine the OpenLibraryClient: Sometimes the title is ugly, e.g. "Der WÃ¼stenplanet - Roman"
- [ ] Get the book cover from OpenLibraryAPI
- [ ] (Optional:) Implement a fallback scenario via another library API
- [X] Borrower field population
- [ ] Set response codes: isbn not found in OpenLibrary -> User has to enter book manually
