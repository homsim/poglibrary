# ToDo
## Generals

- [ ] Add tests (`Mock` ?) especially for the OpenLibraryAPI, because it will probably change over time
- [X] Configure user settings, login and cookies
- [ ] Write an API documentation (`javadoc` ?)
- [ ] Add Logging
- [ ] Configure a test environment that is automatically populated at startup
- [ ] Configure a "customer"-live environment that does NOT empty the database upon restart
- [ ] Add a backup API as fallback for OpenLibrary

## Additional features

- [ ] Include API requests to get the book covers (possible via OpenLibraryAPI on some other endpoint)
