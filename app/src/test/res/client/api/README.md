The content of this directory holds API responses of the backend as `.json`-files. The idea is to include a postman project that includes a folder which can be run regularly to automatically write all responses to a file. The file will then be split into separate files using some script to serve as regular update on the backend's status.
This has all still to be done. It would be best to execute the split-script before each run of the unit tests.
