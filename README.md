# General idea

The general idea is to build a library system that archives all owned books, the affiliation and/or who has borrowed a book.

# Run for development

The build process is handle by `gradle`. From within the projects root directory, run

```
./gradlew :backend:bootRun
```

to run the backend. As of now the app is in active development and only runs on an emulator in android-studio
